# ðŸ§° Custom 3D-Printed Home Server Rack

![Server Main Image](/images/server_main.png)

This project showcases a fully custom-designed and 3D-printed home server rack, built to organize and consolidate my networking gear into a clean, compact footprint.

The idea began as a way to clean up the clutter of wall-wart power supplies, tangled CAT5e cables, and miscellaneous hardware sitting loosely on a shelf. Since I live in an apartment, relocating the coax line to a more hidden spot wasn't an option. I explored commercial 10" server racks, but found them overpriced for my needsâ€”so I decided to build my own.

UsingÂ Fusion 360, I designed every component of the rack and printed them using PLA. To save space and improve airflow, IÂ disassembled both the router and network switch, removing their bulky housings and mounting only the PCBs inÂ custom-printed brackets. I also designedÂ a Raspberry Pi tray which houses two units.

### ðŸ”Œ Hardware Layout

- **Device Trays**
  - Custom-mountedÂ **router PCB**
  - Custom-mountedÂ **network switch PCB**
  - Two custom-mounted **RaspberryPi units**
- **Power**
  - AÂ **5V power supply**Â for the Raspberry Pis and switch  
  - AÂ **9V power supply**Â for the router
- **Cabling**
  - All cables routed internally for a clean and efficient setup

This build reflects my passion for functional design, DIY networking solutions, and space-efficient engineering. Itâ€™s now the backbone of my home lab, keeping everything tidy, powered, and easy to access.
